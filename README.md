# Falkirk Trail Runners League

# Race_manager

Building a web app that lets a club (Falkirk Trail Runners) runner track their progress against the various races throughout the season.

Each runner will belong to a club (more-detail to be developed via extension) but will compete individually in 'races' against other runners.

As keen runner, you want to stay up to date with the race results. You're interested to see which runner leads the table and the latest times tracked against the race.

The MVP will allow for:

User can create, edit, delete runners from the league
User to add a Race (game) once the race has been run and time submitted.
display all runners who have competed in the race and their times or competed in a number of segments
Extensions:

runners can view the club league table to compare against club runners for aggregate data i.e. sort by total elevation climbed, total duration, number of runs, segment scores etc
Extract progress for runners over a number of runs
